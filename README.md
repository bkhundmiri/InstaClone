# InstaClone

## Overview

**InstaClone** is a RESTful Application using Ruby on Rails as a fully independent backend database and React as an interactive frontend. PostgreSQL syntax is being applied for queries to the database. InstaClone mimics the functionality of Instagram and showcases a different approach to the popular social media app.

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure
